	  <b>Who am I?</b><br><br>
	  I’m Preksha Kashyap (<i>Preɪkʃa Kʌʃyʌp</i> for those of you who know a thing or two about the International Phonetic Alphabet). You could liken the pronunciation of my name to: <i>Pray-ksha Cuh-sh-yup</i> as well. <br><br>

	  I’m currently an undergraduate student of the Computer Engineering programme at the University of Waterloo!
	  <br><br>
	  I enjoy taking photos using my Canon XSi (though I am by no means a pro). I also really like perusing my feeds (see: <a id="readingLink2" href="/reading">Reading</a> ) and enjoy gaming from time to time <i>(Portal I & II, Team Fortress 2, Kingdom Hearts I & II, Metal Gear Solid 4).</i>
