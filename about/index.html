	  Why did I get a site? The tag-line says it all.<br>
	  My non-industry mom has been advising me to get a personal site for a while now so I can share a bit of myself with the world.<br><br>

	  So let’s get to know me a bit better: <br>

	  Who am I? <br>
	  I’m Preksha Kashyap (Preɪkʃa Kʌʃyʌp for those of you who know a thing or two about the International Phonetic Alphabet). You could liken the pronunciation of my name to: Pray-ksha Cush-yup as well. <br>

	  I’m currently an undergraduate student of Computer Engineering programme at the University of Waterloo!
