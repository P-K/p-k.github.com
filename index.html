	  	The tagline says it all: it really was my mum who convinced me to get my own site together.<br><br>
	  	So here it is. Nothing fancy. I'm simply using Jekyll to template my site, and the rest is chalked up to HTML, CSS and some jQuery. Altogether, I started and pretty much wrapped up the general structure of the site in one sitting (a.k.a my Sunday morning). Howver, I forsee a bunch of design changes coming down the pipeline.
