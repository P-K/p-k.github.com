	  	<b>v.1.0 - September 30, 2012</b><br><br> 
	  	The tagline says it all: it really was my mum who convinced me to get my own site together.<br><br>
	  	So here it is. Nothing fancy. I'm simply using Jekyll to template my site, and the rest is chalked up to HTML, CSS and some jQuery. <br><br>

	  	Everything came together using Sublime Text Editor 2 (+ some Vim) and  GIMP on Ubuntu 12.04.

	  	Altogether, I started and pretty much wrapped up the general structure of the site in one sitting (a.k.a my Sunday morning). However, I forsee a bunch of design changes coming down the pipeline!
